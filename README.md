# Basis Forms

Basis forms is a cloud-based application that aims to revolutionize institution-tailored data gathering by creating customizable forms.

The application defines a single parent organization which can then add other institutions on demand to give them a customized workspace. The institutions then can manage users, projects, forms, and collected data.
